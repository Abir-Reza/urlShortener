# Project Title: Url Shortener
* **Short Description:** An web application where, a user can enter an arbitrary URL "X" and gets a shortened URL in return.


## Client-Side code link:

## Functional Requirements
1. A user can enter an arbitrary URL "X" on the website and get a shortened URL in return.
2. On visiting the shortened URL, the user gets redirected to "X".
3. The shortening has to be idempotent, i.e. a given URL always has to yield the same short URL as a result.
4. [Bonus, if you feel like it :)] On the website, the user can also see stats for all shortUrls that have been generated (by anyone) on the site:
    * For each shortUrl, how often did someone attempt to shorten that specific URL?
    * For each shortUrl, how often was it visited?

## System Design:
#### What is URL shortener?
A URL shortener is a service that creates a shorter alias for a long URL. When user clicks on the short link, the service redirects to the original link.
There already exist some URL shortener service, for example- bitly.com . 
#### General Overview:
Firstly, Client insert arbitary URL for shortening. At the client side, it checks if the URL is valid or not. Checking URL validation is implemented by regular expression. 
Here is a little explanation about the function for checking valid URL -
``` 
const isValidUrl =(url) => {
        const regex = /^(?:http(s)?:\/\/)?[\w.-]+(?:\.[\w\.-]+)+[\w\-\._~:/?#[\]@!\$&'\(\)\*\+,;=.]+$/;
        const flag =regex.test(url);
        return flag;       
    }

```
If the URL is valid, the URL is sent to server, server checks if the URL already exists in database or not. If exist it is shown on URL list to client and if not then, a short code is generated by token generator and then stored in database. Every time client try to shorten URL, the attempt is counted and stored in database also. <br />
 User gets a list containing LongUrl, short code, attempt to shorten and number of total visit by redirecting short code. <br /> 
 When user clicks the short code, server collects the respective longUrl from database and redirects to the original URL and increments the visitCount by 1. For better understanding a figure of client,server,database communication attached -

#### Issue while searching existing URL:
If there is a large number of URL in database, it is difficult to find that in normal way. MongoDb offers a solution for this, which is called "Indexing". The idea is, rather than searching from the whole collection, it creates a separate index. So whenever anyone search for specific item, it directly points to the index corresponding item. By default "_id" is index in mongoDB, But developer can add other attributes as index according to their need.  <br />
The image shows that before indexing , searching longUrl need all documents to be examined. <br />

The image shows that after indexing , only corresponding document is searched. <br />

#### Encoding Algorithm:
To compute unique shortened code , I used **Base62** convertion. That means, the generated strings contain letters from **[A-z,a-z,0-9]** and in total it is 64.
While creating the Short code, there is an important question that what shoud be length of the generated code? 
* If the code contains 6 letters, there will be 64<sup>6</sup> possible unique code. 
* If the code contains 7 letters, there will be 64<sup>7</sup> possible unique code. 

But I decided not to be fixed in the length of the string. Code will start generating 6 letters srting and will continue to generate strings of 7 length, even if it exceeds the limit(64<sup>6</sup>) of 6 length.<br />

In addition, rather than converting the whole URL, I generated a 64Base code and assigned the long URL to the code. The algorithm takes a number as argument and convert it into base64 to generate a Short code. The value of the input increases by one every time, sothat there is no chance of creating same short code again.<br />
The algorithm used for convertion is attached here: <br />

```
 const tokenGenerator = function(id) {
    const Base62 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
    const baseSize = Base62.length;
    let tokenarray = [];
    while (id > 0){      
      Remainder = id % baseSize;
      tokenarray.push(Base62[Remainder]);
      id = Math.floor(id / baseSize);
      }        
    token = tokenarray.join("");     
    return token;      
}
```
#### DataBase:
NoSQL database is used for the service. 
The database Schema- <br/>
1. **longUrl:** The long URL given by the user.
2. **urlcode:** Shortened code. 
3. **shortUrl:** Short code attached with server url .
4. **attemptCount:** For counting total attempt to shorten a specific URL.
5. **visitCount:** For counting the total visit of the original URL by hitting the shortened code.
